                Simply put, web monetisation refers to the process of turning web traffic (i.e. site visits) into a revenue stream. Online, we are surrounded by various
                models of web monetisation, from advertising, to subscription sign-ups, to the selling of the data collected about site visitors, to the sale of products
                and services, and much more.
